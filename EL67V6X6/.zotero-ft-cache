 The Grammar of Neoliberalism
Benjamin Noys (2010)
(A)Moral Critique
Nietzsche famously remarked that ‘I am afraid we are not rid of God becau se we still have faith in gram mar. ’ What I am concern ed with is tha t alt hou gh we are witne ssi ng a glo bal fin anc ial cri sis , and therefore the crisis of neo-liberalism, that the ‘grammar’ of neo- liberalism still dominates our thinking, and most perniciously, as I presume, the thinking of ‘us’ as those resistant to neo-liberalism as a specific form of governmental rationality, and more generally to capitalism as a social form. I am not excluding myself from this ‘set’, I claim no immunity or position of moral superiority; this, I think, is a re su lt of on e of th e tr ut hs of Ma rx is m, wh ich is no t, as Fr ed ri c  Jameson constantly points out, a
moral
critique, but rather a critique that begins from the actual and real contradictions, antagonisms, and tensions of the existing social forms, which is to say
capitalist 
forms. In fact, as Jameson notes a moral critique all too often stands in fo r Ma rx is t cr it iq ue , in th e re ac ti on ar y fo rm di ag no se d by Nietz sche as a mech anism of value -posi ting, hierarch isatio n, and generator of a (bad)
ressentiment

Foucault focuses on two sites of the emergence of neo-liberalism: Germany, first in the 1920s and 1930s, and then at the centre of post-World War II German policy, and Am eri can ana rch o-c api tal ism . Wh at Fo uca ult str ess es is the nov elt y of neo -li ber ali sm com par ed to cla ssi cal lib era lis m – jus t putting Adam Smith on the £20 note does not claim a real fidelity, but merely a fantasmatic one. Whereas classical liberalism tried to restrict the state’s interference to open up a space for the market, un de r th e sc he ma of 
laissez-faire
, neo -lib era lis m ope rat es a re- organisation of the state itself which is superimposed by the market. We move from, in Foucault’s words: ‘a state under the supervision of the market rather than a market supervised by the state.’ (116) It was the extinction of the Nazi state that made post-war Ge rm an y th e id ea l si te to re -f ou nd th e st at e in te rm s of th e eco nom ic, in whi ch leg iti mat ion was ach iev ed thr oug h eco nom ic gr ow th ra th er th an in po li ti ca l te rm s. At th e sa m e ti me ne o- liberalism solidifies a ‘state-phobia’, by arguing that the tendency of  an y in te rv en ti on to a st at e- co nt ro ll ed eco no my , pl an ni ng , an d economic interventionism will lead to Nazism or totalitarianism. In a provocative series of formulations Foucault argues that this ‘state pho bia ’ per me ate s mo der n tho ugh t, ali gni ng the cri tiq ue of the spectacle (Debord) and ‘one-dimensionality’ (Marcuse) with Werner Sombart’s proto-Nazi critiques of capitalism (113-4). Here we might say we can see the emergence of the ‘grammar’ argument, in the sense of a common phobia of the state that leaves us vulnerable to his tor ica l re- ins cri pti on und er the ter ms of neo -li ber ali sm , or , as Fou cau lt put s it: ‘All tho se who shar e in the great state phob ia should know that they are following the direction of the wind and that in fact, for years and years, an effective reduction of the state has been on the way, a reduction of both the growth of state control and of a “statifying” and “statified”
 
governmentality.’ (191-2)

What is the precise nature, then, of neo-liberalism? Of course, the obvious objection to the ‘anti-state’ vision of neo-liberalism is that neo-liberalism itself is a continual form of state intervention, usually summarised in the phrase ‘socialism for the rich, capitalism for the poor’. Foucault notes that neo-liberalism concedes this: ‘neo- liberal government intervention is no less dense, frequent, active, and con tin uou s tha n in any oth er sys tem .’ (14 5) The dif fer enc e, however, is the
 point 
of application. It intervenes on society ‘so that co m pe ti ti ve me ch an is m s ca n pl ay a re gu la to ry ro le at ev er y moment and every point in society and by intervening in this way its objective will become possible, that is to say, a general regulation of  society by the market.’ (145) Therefore, we miss the point if we simply leave a critique of neo-liberalism at the point of saying ‘neo- liberalism is as statist as other governmental forms’. Instead, the necessity if to analyse how neo-liberalism creates a new form of  governmentality in which the state performs a different function: permeating society to subject it to the economic.  The state intervention of neo-liberalism is
Kantian
; i t i s de si gn ed to ac t on th e co nd it io ns of th e so ci al to cr ea te th e possibility of competition and enterprise. Neo-liberalism is opposed to the spectre of the passive consumer just as much as various forms of leftism and anarchism, instead it what to bring forth the person of enterprise and production. At the same time, and Foucault tr ac es th e ro ot s of Ge rm an ne o- li be ra li sm in th e fo ll ow er s of  Husserl, this competition does not emerge ‘naturally’ but only as an essence that has to be constructed and formalised: neo-liberalism is
Husserlian
. Unlike in classical liberalism, we cannot ‘free’ market fr om th e st at e an d ex pe ct co mp et it io n to em er ge ‘n at ur al ly ’. Instead, the state constantly intervenes to construct competition at all levels, so that the market economy is the ‘general index’ for all governmental action (121). A text by the German economist Wilhelm Röpke from 1950 sets out the objectives of government as allowing access to private 3

as Foucault says: ‘You will recognize this text; it has been repeated 25,000 times for the last 25 years.’ (148) We could add it’s being repeated now as well, as the ‘big society’. At the heart of this vision, wh ic h is wh at ma ke s it ne o- li be ra l is ‘t hi s mu lt ip li ca tio n of th e “enterprise” form within the social body is what is at stake in neo- liberal policy. It is a matter of making the market, competition, and so the enterprise, into what could be called the formative power of  society.’ (148) Fou cau lt’ s poi nt, wh ich is ger man e to my ana lys is, is tha t critics of ‘standardizing, mass society of consumption and spectacle, et ce te ra , ar e mi st ak en wh en th ey th in k th ey ar e cr it ic iz in g th e cu r r en t o b j ec t iv e o f g ov er n m en t po li cy .’ (1 49 ) N eo -l ib er al governmentality is not Keynesian, and contemporary society ‘is not or ie nt at ed to wa rd s th e co mm od it y an d th e un if or mi ty of th e co mm od it y, bu t to wa rd s th e mu lt ip li ci ty an d di ff er en ti at io n of  enterprises.’ (149) We can then group together this series of forms to no te th at ne o- li be ra li sm po se s a mo de of in te rv en ti on th at pr of ou nd ly re -s ha pe s so ci al fo rm s by ac ti ng on th e co nd it io ns , especially the legal conditions, under which society operates, and wh ic h pa ys no he ed to th e ‘n at ur al ne ss ’ of ma rk et s fo rm s, bu t rather treating them as something to be constructed.

I will list the objectives he fixes: first, to enable as far as possible everyone to have access to private property; second, the reduction of huge urban sprawls and the rep lac eme nt of lar ge sub urbs with a pol icy of med ium -si zed tow ns, the replacement of the policy and economics of large housing blocks with a policy and ec on om ic s of pr iv at e ho us es , th e en co ur ag em en t of sm al l fa rm s in th e countryside, and the development of what he calls non-proletarian industries, that is to say, craft industries and small businesses; third, decentralization of places of  residence, production, and management, correction of the effects of specialization and the: division of labor; and the organic reconstruction of society on the basis of  natural communities, families, and neighborhoods; finally, generally organizing, developing, and controlling possible effects of the environment arising either from people living together or through the development of enterprises and centers of  production.
