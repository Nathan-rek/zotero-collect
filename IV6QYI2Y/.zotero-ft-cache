Simple Net Art Diagram

MTAA

1997
Created by artist duo MTAA, Simple Net Art Diagram (SNAD) is a schematic illustration of two computer terminals connected by a line and a red lightning bolt labeled “The art happens here.” Through an extreme economy of form, the now-iconic image conveys complex concepts about net art: first, that it “happens,” and therefore can be thought of as an action or a performance; and second, that it is defined by in-betweenness.

Since its publication in the late 1990s, Simple Net Art Diagram has functioned as a kind of net art meme, remade by other artists to reflect differing conceptions of net art. Embracing this evolution, MTAA have released it under a Creative Commons license that permits alteration and reuse.

“Art as an active site, open to those who care
Information as a stance, opposition in the air
Participation as the norm, inclusion across the board
Time as a fluid state, now to be ignored” —MTAA

SNAD was initially published by the duo as part of their project TIME! (1997), in which participants could purchase a print of their own likeness as seen by the artists via the early videoconferencing system CU-SEE ME.

TIME! thus realized the kind of live, performative, networked encounter illustrated by SNAD. MTAA wanted to convey to audiences that the artwork wasn’t just what was on their screens, but the exchange or dialogue itself.

Belying the diagram’s apparent simplicity, the “here” in SNAD can be interpreted in multiple ways: as the physical infrastructure of the internet, as a network context from which a work cannot be extracted without altering it fundamentally, and as the space between users, where no clear distinction is drawn between author and audience.

In 2003, artist Abe Linkoln (Rick Silva) reimagined the work as the Complex Net Art Diagram, the first in a series of remakes over the ensuing years.

In response, MTAA released the work under a Creative Commons Attribution 2.5 license, explicitly permitting others to reuse and reinterpret it as long as they credit the original authors.
