Press Text
MAMA presents The Fear Of Missing Out, the latest exhibition by Swedish artist Jonas Lund (SE, 1984). The title derives from a social network induced anxiety condition. One brought on by trying to keep up with a rapidly moving world. A fear of constantly being one-step behind, in the wrong place, and missing out on the most exciting events. The Fear Of Missing Out proposes that it is possible to be one step ahead of the art world by using well-crafted algorithms and computational logic.

The works in the show are the result of a computer algorithm written by Lund. By analysing and categorizing a wide range of artworks, by the most successful contemporary artists, a set of instructions were generated explaining, step by step, how to make the most successful works of art. The artist then simply made the work following the instructions. In The Fear of Missing Out, important categories from the art world such as authenticity, artistry, talent, and creativity are questioned. The title also refers to the urge to be a part of a transparent information society made up of an overarching digital network.

Last year, Jonas Lund worked intensively with MAMA´s curator, Gerben Willers. The pre-opening of The Fear of Missing Out takes place on Friday 27 September. Lund will then work in-situ, on the realization of works, until the exhibition opens on 11 October.

As an art institute, MAMA is home to a large group of young people and provides a place for the latest talent. Young artists and art professionals are intensively supported through the making of new exhibitions, publications, artworks, etc., with the help of MAMA’s staff.
