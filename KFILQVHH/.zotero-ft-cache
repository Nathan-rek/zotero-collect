About
Constraint Systems is a collection of experimental web-based creative tools. They are an ongoing attempt to explore alternative ways of interacting with pixels and text on a computer screen. I hope to someday build these ideas into something larger, but the plan for now is to keep the scopes small and the releases quick.
