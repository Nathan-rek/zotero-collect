Prabhavathi Meppayil se/hundred and nine , 2018

Gesso panels stamped with thinnam
45,7 x 61 x 5 cm each (4 panels)
Inquire

se/hundred and nine consists of four panels covered in layers of white gesso whose surface has been marked with a thinnam—a traditional jewelry tool used by goldsmiths. The shape of the tool also determines the shape of the panels and the composition they form on the wall. The traces and imprints left on the panels vary according to the force and angle with which the metal tip hits the surface of the lime gesso.
