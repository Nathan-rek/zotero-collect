BASQUIAT HARING WARHOL
BASTOK LESSEL is pleased to present a curated exhibition bringing together over twenty paintings and works on paper from three art icons of the 20th century:  Jean-Michel Basquiat  (1960-1988),  Keith Haring  (1958-1990) and  Andy Warhol  (1928-1987) at the same time in the Dubai DIFC (February 26th - May 4th) and Paris (March 2nd - May 4th) galleries.
 

Between friendship and prolific artistic collaboration, Jean-Michel Basquiat, Keith Haring and Andy Warhol became pioneering figures of contemporary art. Embodying the exuberant madness of the New York downtown of the 1980s, the three artists were distinguished by their singular aesthetics, marked by innovative and sometimes audacious concepts that often served their socio-political convictions.

Throughout the 1980s, the three New York-based artists looked into a range of issues related to their personal identities, as well as topics including the criticism of capitalism, apartheid, AIDS, and climate change. All three artists died prematurely— Jean-Michel Basquiat was 28 when he passed away in 1988 due to an overdose, Keith Haring died of AIDS two years later, aged 31, and Andy Warhol at 58 following a surgery.

Jean-Michel BASQUIAT  (1960-1988)

The art world started to take notice of Basquiat’s paintings in 1980, during the "Times Square Show", which was organised by a group of punk and graffiti underground artists. Besides calling out the injustices and hypocrisies of the time, his work was frequently associated with the improvisational nature of jazz, with its abundant surface references that arose as patterns made of lists, diagrams, symbols, brushstrokes and even photocopies which became an emblematic element of his language especially in the Xerox series of which  Untitled , 1982 is a fine example.

Keith HARING  (1958-1990)

With a brief but incredibly prolific career, Haring was renowned for his elaborate compositions, recurring images, as well as for his thick and fluid lines as exemplified by his monumental works on paper that features some of his most significant motifs as well as his iconic technique. Since the 1980s, Haring’s work has become internationally acclaimed, shattering stereotypes and shedding light on a variety of challenging subjects such as sexuality, racism, capitalism, and the rapid advancement of new technologies. His chalk drawings in the city subway stations are a testament to the public dimension of his art, often involving collaborations with youth in the creation of large-scale murals.

Andy WARHOL  (1928-1987)

Warhol a prominent player in the art scene, as a visual artist, film director, and producer, explored the link between pop culture and artistic expression. From the 1960s to the 1980s, his New York Studio, “The Factory”, was the epicenter for musicians, artists, politicians and celebrities like Judy Garland and Liza Minelli, a hive of intense creative activity where partnerships and original works were produced. By the time Basquiat and Haring appeared on the scene, Warhol was already a well- known and successful artist.

Through their unique imagery, bold concepts, and nuanced socio-political commentary, Basquiat and Haring both turned the 1980s art scene around and left an enduring legacy. Their joint efforts mirrored the social challenges and metropolitan setting in which they lived. In their collaborations, Basquiat's raw, passionate text and imagery and Haring's energetic line drawings masterfully blended together. Their mutual investigation of issues like inequality, race, and identity struck a deep chord with the social and political context of the day. Haring and Basquiat had a complex personal and professional relationship that was characterised by rivalry as much as camaraderie. Their connection began in the thriving art scene of the city in the 1980s, and their encounters had a profound impact on each other’s path. They both officially met Warhol in 1982.

Even if the legend holds that Warhol paid $1 for a postcard that Basquiat gave him at their first meeting in 1979, it was not until 1982 that mutual acquaintance and art dealer Bruno Bischofberger properly introduced the two. He suggested that the two start collaborating, and together, Basquiat and Warhol made about 160 paintings between 1984 and 1985, some of the largest pieces of their career. Their partnership involved both artistic exchange and friendship. It not only brought Basquiat into more prominence than it had previously been, but it also sparked renewed interest in Warhol. Basquiat looked up to Warhol as an accomplished artist, a major figure in the art world, the creator of a new language, and someone who had a revolutionary approach to pop culture. In response, Warhol discovered a rekindled passion for painting in Basquiat, thanks to whom he found himself inspired enough to go back to large-scale manual painting.

After seeing how well they got along and how their collaboration worked, Haring described how two minds came together to form a "third distinctive and unique mind" and how a "conversation occurred through painting, instead of words".

The artists originally met at one of Haring's exhibitions at the Shafrazi Gallery, according to Warhol's diaries. Warhol was already regarded as a legend in his area at that time, whereas Haring's career was just getting started. Following a visit to Haring's studio, where he was struck by the spontaneity of the dancing figures, Warhol and Haring became friends in 1983. Warhol was considered by Haring as a key inspiration and early backer of his career. He would say: “Andy's life and work made my work possible. Andy set the precedent for the possibility for my art to exist”.

Bastok Lessel’s exhibition highlights how the three artists crossed paths and mutually influenced one another in the creation of the pop art imagery that shaped the vibrant 1980s New York scene. As their heritage lives on, Basquiat, Haring and Warhol made an unforgettable contribution to defining the contemporary archetypes we all experience on a daily basis still today.
