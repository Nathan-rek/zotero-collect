Description

The theme of the presentation of Montenegro at the Biennale Architettura 2023 is set on the wealth of natural resources, heritage, and people whose talent created artefacts of the past of permanent value. The intention is to create interactive atmosphere and experience that bring architecture and concepts back into the context of Heritage values and, as such, in the near future can open up the most valuable topics in the (re)shaping of the Landscape of the Future and, above all, open and establish a creative and free dialogue of the most gifted and the most responsible in the creation of New Harmonised Paradigms .
