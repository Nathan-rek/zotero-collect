Eclectic Tech Carnival 2018 @ XM24 Bologna, Italy

The Eclectic Tech Carnival (/ETC) is a gathering of people who critically use/study/share/ improve everyday information technologies in the context of the free speech and open hardware movements. We are a collective body of feminists with a particular history, who chew on the roots of control and domination. Events are organised locally and autonomously where there is a desire to host an /ETC. Everyone participates in skill sharing to expand our knowledges.

The content of the workshops could be transcripted thanks to audio records, pads and personal notes.
The 2018 edition of the Eclectic Tech Carnival in Bologna gathered workshops and talks about 8 main themes: arts, DIY, feminism, games, hardware, open source, programming and security. Through the book, when something is about one of these themes, it is marked in the margins of the page with the following graphic signs (one per theme) and pages references for the previous and the next occurrence of the theme. The idea of this system was to show the richness of the event and how themes crossed eachother all along the workshops.

Hardware crash course
Donna

I was in a hacklab at the beginning of the 2000, with women who found boxes full of computer components. 10} µA gender changer is a panel of interface. Sometimes devices don’t connect and you have to use an adapter. And some of the panels have pins, it is called male, some have holes, it is called feminine. For the people

developing this technology it was obvious. That’s why we called our group the gender changers, making workshops with hardware, unconstructing it. It’s a nice way to understand how machines work. µThe mouse is called a clit. The gender changer is separated in a master and slave cable inside. Slave branch

doesn't depend on the master.

{9 32}

µSo it makes no sense to call it

this way. Master and slave are

written on drives. It's the

reflection of a culture in IT.

Tunnel up, tunnel down
Mara Elenis Daughter

This is about different types of VPN, why to use it, vulnera12} bilities of VPN... ~We all know about VPN, it is Virtual Private Network, allows the user to connect securely and privately on the Internet. VPN can happen between users (remote access VPN). The VPN encrypts the first request. There can be VPN between

two companies if they want to have secure connections between ressources. And there is VPN when you’re home, this is a remote access VPN. Connection between your computer and the server is encrypted and the VPN forwards your request to the browser. You can be a user, but you can also use it in your company. You set

11 Security/Encryption

it up and then get a connection.

{11 13}

~SSH is a secure way to connect

to a server. For two private

networks of companies, it

enables the two to connect to

eachother.

Q|The connection, is it physical? A||No, you init getaway, configures one server with a secret key, it’s wireless.

Some companies use IPSec, which is a protocol for VPNs. IPSec is easier to setup when you have a static IP, like companies do. As users, we use OpenVPN. IPs are behind a firewall, some configurations of IPSec allow you to go through it. As a user you don’t have a fix IP, and OpenVPN is easier with moving IPs. IPSec uses pre-shared key for configuration, it must be on the two servers, OpenVPN uses certificates. IPSec cannot scale up, there can’t be several

servers using the same preshared key. You use certificate when you want to scale up. IPSec is easier because you don’t have to generate a certificate. The certificate enables to connect through different IPs, it is the identification of the connection. You have a public key and a private one with OpenVPN, you share the public one. The receiver can only decrypt your data with your public key.
Q|Is it like an Intranet for companies? A||Yes, exactly
~VPN offers integrity and security. It ensures the data was not altered between the two nodes: sent data is the same length as the one that 13} arrived. #The hash algorithm makes it, SH3 is the last version, very recent. For the history, it was developed by the NSA, so it asks questions about

12 Security/Encryption Programming

Tunnel up, tunnel down

{12 14}

the monopoly. ~This algorithm

makes sure you are who you

say you are, it’s a signature.

Then you have authentication

to access the server. Pre-shared

keys enables to have the same

keys at the beginning and the

end and check it is the same.

Shared keys are about authen-

tication. Then there is the

encryption part. Data becomes

unreadable unless you decrypt

it. The server will have your

public key or pre-shared key

and use it to decrypt the data.

Assymetric encryption is used

most of the time. When you

receive data, it is decrypted

with your private key. Symetric

encryption is made with a

single key.

{12 17}

#Those algorithms are behind

most encryption we use: SSH,

FTP, PGP (email ecryption)

and in general for password

keys. Hellman key is quite

known too. The result of the

connection is the same, but we

never know the private key. IPSec VPN are mostly used, latest use Internet key protocol: Layer 2 is used a lot on mobile VPN, but it’s not so secured. By default in Android, IPSec and Layer 2 are combined. Layer 2 is mostly about creating a tunnel, and IPSec is used for encryption. So Internet key exchange is a kind of wrap-up. You can install IPSec with different tools. It’s a software you use to process the install, it’s more complicated to configure. It’s good to have a tunnel between companies or organizations servers. It allows any access to the servers normally. VPN prevents man in the middle attack, because we know who connects and we are sure of the identity. OpenVPN use Diffie-Hellman by default, but you can change the length of the key for more security. But anyway there are still vulnerabilities. Edward Snowden revealed the NSA can

Mara Elenis Daughter

13 Security/Encryption Programming

intercept many VPN exchanges and decrypt it, like 2 /3.

Q|Why don’t simple users use pre-shared key as you showed? A||Because as a user you are behind a router, your IP changes sometimes, so with a pre-shared key you would have to reconfigure your server with your new IP address. It’s about integrity indeed. It assumes you sign what you send, this is your signature. Companies use preshared keys for configuring the connection in the network, then to make more connections they use certificates.

To come a bit to the context of

/ETC, I could cite Systerserver,

which is a feminist server, and

also Anarchia in Calafou, in

{13 29}

Spain. ~And to say why you

should get a VPN: if you down-

load torrent, it’s more secure

through VPN, and if you’re in a

country that controls the

Internet, your computer goes to the Internet through another country and you can access sites you may not usually see.

Open source sustainability
Helen

This isn’t really a workshop, it's 17} a discussion: >I would like to
talk about how we sustain open source projects over the years specifically arts, feminist & queer open source software 17} projects. `I will use the example of UpStage, an open source platform for cyberformance (online performance) that I've been involved in nurturing &

sustaining since 2003. I'll talk about how we have managed to sustain it despite receiving very little funding, & what that has cost us in non-monetary terms. I’m interested to hear the experiences of others who are involved in similar projects, & in looking at various alternative models for achieving sustainability for unfunded or very

16 Free & Open source Creativity/Arts

low-funded projects; how we

might be able to support each

other’s endeavours and what

we can learn from each others’

experiences.

How can we keep open source

{16 41}

going ? `UpStage is a project for

web performances in a brow-

ser, developed especially with a

programmer. We gave work-

shops in schools and /ETC.

Students in New Zealand work

on the project. Second version

in 2007, 12 hours of continuous

live performance.

>Open source sustainability is

not about money, it's also

community, what we've done

with the money. The environ-

ment keeps evolving. New

platform is on Github. A new

code has been restarted. There

is a big lack of streaming plat-

forms. Maybe we can exchange

development processes, the

code, documentation of re-

deployment. It can't rest on one

person. It's not sustainable if

resting only on one person.

UpStage has a backlog, compa-

rativeness not to lose the

features. It's a lot about the

recognition for the contribu-

tors. It implies sometimes

working for a long time without

money. Missing link between

projects and volunteers is

money, so some fundings are

given. Fundings given must

have some kind of sustainabi-

lity behind. Fundings can be

cut if the administrations

decide it. Foundations like

fundings. No one wants to

make the documentation while

it's super important, it's not the

{17 19}

funny part of the job. >Tails is a

free software project. Each new

feature is written in the docu-

mentation. A part of the code

became sustainable as it was

given to Gnome and is now

used by Ubuntu users. To find

fundings you have to go

through many steps. How to

create a balance between

responsibility and envolvment

in the projects? Someone who's

been there long time to keep it

going. It's important to have a

leader. If there is not you can

cultivate it and get persons

emerging for it.

A brief history of Linux
Aileen

{18 20}

>This is a very subjective Linux

story. It’s a huge history, but

I’ll give it to you from from my

prospective. I have been a

translator for 25 years, I started

with computer books. So my

own history with Linux started

in 1995, with a book on Linux

published in 1994. I knew what

an operating system was and

working with emails, I was

excited about it. At the very end of this book there is a chapter on network application, a few pages about World Wide Web saying: "this is new, it could be interesting". A book on Linux in 2018 is 2000 pages. That’s a lot of history, we will look at segments. In this history is Richard Stallman, Linus Torvald... they made great

19 Free & Open source

contribution to the code.

Erika Reman is remembered as

{19 21}

making copies. >Those men are

heroes of open source, admi-

red, everybody wants to be

22} Linus Torvald. ^In comparison,

women in the history of tech-

nology, they don’t have the

same place. About Ada

Lovelace it is said: "maybe she

didn’t contribute that much, we

don’t know. It’s not quite clear

what was hers or what she

did". Grace Hopper: "you know

the history of the bug is not

what we think". Margaret

Hamilton: "no, she did not in-

vent the term ’software engi-

neering’, it was popular before

that". Hedy Lamarr: "you know

she didn’t really invent any-

thing, she just had ideas, she’s

{17 32}

not a real inventor". #Lets’ not

talk about them, let’s not talk

about Grace Hopper writing

the first compiler, let’s not talk

about Margaret Hamilton, who

wrote the code that brought

humanity on the moon. Let’s

not talk about Hedy Lamarr, who brought technologies we used today like Bluetooth. Lets’ get stuck on talking about men. This is 100 years old. Women’s names are associated with something trivial, it is not that important. This is how women are written in history. Human people are differently talked about, depending on if they are men or women. For Linux, in the beginning there was Unix. >AT&T was a public infrastructure, so Unix was a public resource. That changed in the 70s’. AT&T started changing licences. So the University of Berkeley developed their own version of Unix, called BSD, that was a free software. BSD Linux was the distribution. While this process was running, Unix was growing, more and more institutionalized, comercialized, becoming really expensive. Richard Stallman, who was working at the Free Software

Free & Open source
20 Feminism Programming

A brief history of Linux

Foundation, insisted on the

information to be free, speci-

fically free as in speech, not as

a beer. So it has to be a public

resource and utility. He was

working on another system as

Unix, but something was

{20 22}

missing. >1971: release of Unix.

1979: BSD. 1985: Free Software

Foundation is created to

support the free software

movement, with possibility to

use, study and modify. 1991, a

student in Finland, Linus

Torvald, was working on his

own project through mailing

lists. When he started releasing

it other developers were inte-

rested. >In 1994, first version of

Linux kernel was released.

This kernel was the exact

missing piece for Richard

Stallman’s project. Mailings

lists and groups that started in

the 1990s’ made it possible by

exchange, to work on develo-

ping it together. There was

never a strict authority on the

development of Linux. Often

professional developers on their free time and by employees of big institutions. All the books I translated were written by men, especially by men who had really good jobs in universities and institutions. So about the idea that there is no hierarchy, that if you can code you can contribute, the idea of meritocracy (if it’s good enough, it doesn't matter where you come from). But indeed, it is made by men with good jobs on their free time. It means you need to have free time. I always got frustrated about that, because I wanted to get involved, but I had no free time. >Mailing lists are a very important aspect of Linux development. Kernel development, assembly... every aspect of Linux, single application. This is where all is discussed. The kernel development is the core. If you can acces this list, you come to the Pantheon, you’re a

hero. 1996: second version of

the kernel. Bigger companies

are getting interested. Compe-

tition with Microsoft in the end

of the 1990s’. 2006: Red Hat

Linux. Google’s Android is also

based on Linux. Ubuntu has its

own history.

{21 23}

>A Linux distribution is the

kernel and a collection of soft-

ware that make an operating

system together. Your choice

on your distribution shows

what you are trying to accom-

plish. Some are commercial:

you don’t buy a license as it has

to be free, but companies pay

enormous amounts of money

for the assitance to keep

running. Linux is maintained

by communities of volunteers.

But who gets to be a volunteer?

This is the most stable opera-

ting system for servers, there

are hundreds of Linux distri-

butions. The kernel is the part

that keeps everything together,

file system that runs the soft-

wares.

Volunteering is appealing,

distribution of everything, we

want to be able to work

{20 23}

together. ^This is why Linux

appealed to me as a feminist

strategy, how to bring us all

together. Idealism is still there,

coming from FSF, and in the

same time, many commercial

interests are implied. But

Linux has grown way too big

and crucial to rely only on

volunteers. The majority of

electronic devices use Linux, it

is in infrastructures, e-com-

merce... Idealism is not dead,

but big companies need Linux

to keep going. The Linux Foun-

dation is supposed to defend

open source and collaborative

development, it reports to be a

neutral governing body, to

make sure development is

funded. In 2016, it paid 1,6

million dollars to Linus Torvald

to free him from responsibi-

lities. Non-profit organizations,

with support of institutions and

big companies. Idealism yes,

22 Free & Open source Feminism

A brief history of Linux

but also reality. There is a myth

about the creation of Linux, a

{22 24}

myth of collaboration. ^Can it

still be a feminist strategy, or

has it gone too far?

Heroic male are falling apart.

After thousands of emails,

Linus Torvald was accused of

being abusive, insulting. There

is a myth that he is a good guy

{22 24}

as he made Linux for free. >But

is it a way to treat with people,

especially by cooperation,

insulting people if their code is

not good enough? In mailing

lists, is it a welcoming environ-

ment? Some developers on the

mailing list working on USB

devices made Linus Torvald

step down of this list for his

behaviour. He refused, so they

went away. ^Another kernel

developer for years wrote on

how to encourage women in

Linux. >Mailing lists for women

in Linux are not that much.

Trying to find ways to

communicate. Linus Torvald

stepped down and decided to make code of conduct in Linux. linuxcodeconduct on Twitter if you want to follow the story. Some developers reacted bad to the fact that feminists brought Torvald to adopt it. He said he is now taking some time off. First Torvald’s answer on a code of conduct was making instead a code of conflict: how do we argue with eachother. Femke Snelting made a lot of research on code of conducts in Linux communities and the function it has in the community.
Q|^What do you think distributions made for feminists, or for women would look like? A||^It would be a distro paying attention to what applications we use, tools for activism, respecting free software, not collecting data in everyday life. Maybe going back to some older tools. Instead of Facebook or to chat, IRC is so simple.

Aileen

23 Feminism Free & Open source

It also has to go with education: what are we using, and why are we using it. It is important to see and think about what we are using.

{23 25}

Q|^There was a queer OS that

was developed based on an old

system, the interface was

thought differently. I don’t

know how far it went.

A||It means we would

have to think on another

model. Not based on the 90s’

meritocracy but from another

point of view. We have

experience in dealing with

collaboration as feminists.

{23 37}

Q|>About volunteering, to me

this is not really this, because

indeed in free software, many

contributors are paid by other

companies.

A||It is part of that

mythology of meritocracy, and

we don’t want to compete on

that same level. Storytelling is a

very powerful tool, we need to

use it better. Who would you accept to be paid by?
Q|^But building a feminist OS, it means also technical competences. We have to process, find how to actualize a distro, how do we do with technical skills. Q||^I think a technical project can be feminist from the beginning, there are many technical women. We feel alone at home if we don’t have a space to gather. As soon as you create the space, people come. The term technology is male, it appeals men and women are more afraid to get into it. If the space is not male coined, other people will come. We have a hackerspace in Berlin for non cis-men, queer, women. In some places gender like hackatons it repeats stereotypes, but is also a way to push men out of it. Q|||^Yes, but it’s not because you're a woman and

24 Feminism Free & Open source

Picture of the workshop

you’re in technology that you

are a feminist, you need a lot of

women.

A||||Google has a

special program for girls, to

empower.

{24 26}

Q|||||^As women,

we wouldn’t have to be better

than others to be recognized.

Q|^Sometimes when I talk about feminist projects, I feel the people is lowing the conversation. I think it is important to support the topic. ^To summarize, a feminist distro should include technicals skills with our values. We know what we don’t want, so let’s think about how to do what we want.

It is an interactive workshop in

which all participants will

reflect on why and how to

manage their identities online

so as to protect the most high-

risk activities, while still having

fun with kittens and social

{14 30}

media. ~If you’re doing sensitive

stuff with your own domain, it

would be better to control your

identity. In many countries, the

State knows your identity online, it is related to your official card. You should use separations for your actions. You do very delicate things with people you trust. From now on my name is not known. Identity is a tool online, it’s like a mask you wear and you can change it.

29 Security/Encryption

Q|Many people think security, identity are not that important, this is one of the problems for a forum I hold. Also, I have to separate online and administrative identities. Sometimes I am both, how do I separate? A||Everyone has a complicated life, one way would be to be an artist and use a nickname, but you must ask people not to publish your name online.

Q|I’m not on Facebook and

people uploaded photos of me

even if I asked them not to.

{29 31}

A||~There should be sepa-

ration at least in the accounts.

You shouldn’t connect delicate

accounts with people you don’t

trust. We miss awareness about

confidentiality.

Q|There are also collective identity, people always try to talk to you personnally through it.

A||Try to find a way to araise imagination. For political action you can create a different email address.
~Malwares are threatening so people invest in security. Be careful with where you define your emails, is it online or on your computer? If you’re an artist, your nickname must be related to your art so that you are identified in it. It’s more a question of public image.
Q|I just realized identity I keep the most is the one I trust. When I started teaching, I needed to change my identity, also for my reputation. I separated the school part, the working part.
Q|Why did you start on identity online from harassment? I don’t think it’s only about that. A||Different identities also not to be exploited?

30 Security/Encryption

Imaginary friends

Q|||Yes, it’s a good case. A||||I would like identity partitioning to work, I’m not sure algorithms are smart enough to connect all that comes from my computer.

Now let’s get into the tools.

{30 32}

~One very important thing is for

sensitive activities, don’t have it

on a telephone because the

tools I will show don’t run on

this device. Or use a SIM card

not connected to your identity.

For PCs, there are two tools to

separate our identities on our

machines. First is Qubes OS.

It is an operating system, it

actually manages several diffe-

rent machines in the machine.

It manages as many virtual

machines as I want. I created

one to have a browser, the

window self-destroys when I

close it. And I have the other

machine for my social net-

works and workshops activi-

ties. In Qubes you create a

setup.

There are some machines I don’t want to connect to the Internet (for instance where I store my passwords): this machine is not connected to the Internet at all. For the Internet, one is connected to Tor, so I decide what machines are connected to my activities and different networks. With the Tor connection, my connections are anonymized. When I shop on the Internet, another machine is the only one to have my bank details. So even if you get malware by misattention, you can delete the affected machine and keep your domain safe. My machines contain Debian or Fedora or Unix, and other machines don’t have their own OS, so they are faster. So you could also have a Windows machine. If you want, you can do stuff between machines anyway. They don’t communicate but you can move files, copy text to the underlying system, download

attachments from Thunderbird.

{20 46}

Q|#I am used to copy pasting

from the command line, is it

possible here?

A||No it’s a graphical

system. As machines don’t

communicate with eachother it

is not possible.

Q|||Maybe you can do it

from the root.

{10 34}

Q|µHow much RAM do you

need for it?

A||I was about to talk

about that. Qubes runs even on

old computers, but it needs lots

of RAM, 8Go, better with 16Go,

so it can’t fit with any machine.

Requires some hardware. With

a 64-bit system it will be better

to use Tails. You love it or you

hate it, that’s the main reac-

tions with Qubes.

Q|With your different machines, do you have several IP addresses?

A||No because all your machines are linked to your network card, you cannot fake this.

Tails is easier when you have a

USB stick ready, then you have

an almost normal Linux system

with it. You start your compu-

ter from the stick, you can have

{31 33}

one stick per identity. ~If you are

doing very sensitive stuff, Tails

never saves data on your hard

disk, you use only the RAM of

your PC. When you shut down

the system the RAM is wiped.

When you start the first time

you have no encrypted system,

so every time you start you use

your operating system. By

default Tails doesn’t give you

root access and it gives you a

new MAC address. You can

directly access Tor or make a

configuration through Bridge,

for machines you wouldn’t like

to connect to network at all. It

has a set of tools for encryption,

Thunderbird with Enigmail

and GPG to use encrypted

email or mailing lists. The

environment is Gnome 3.

{32 46}

~It’s fast, there is a new release

with security every two

months. Inside you have gra-

phic softwares, office soft-

wares... If you take off the key

because you are in a hurry, it

won’t destroy your computer it

just switches off, so it’s very

convenient, in case the police is

coming for instance. Every-

time you run Tails, you have a

clean operating system, so you

can take malware, your system

is still safe. You can also en-

crypt, use anonymity and con-

fidentiality in your exchanges,

and still have your computer

with the life you show to

people.

For instance for a journalist,

who must exchange secretly it’s

really useful. You can travel

with your persistent system.

You can decide what is in your

persistence, how permissive it

is. You decide of it. To make a

persitence, you clone your system. The copies are all the same, you have to check that the keys are signed. A group in Tails is working on a possibility to check the correspondence of the operating system, and give the possibility to compile more often. Qubes is not for hiding, it’s a security system. Tails was invented for activism, Qubes didn’t.

{32 35}

µI am a member of an asso-

ciation that shares skills and

finances to run our own VPS

infrastructure. We all pay a

membership fee and pay for

the VPS services we want to

use. A few of the members run

the infrastructure. An example

of non-commercial, self-

managed, decentralised net-

work technology. This talk will

be very brief but nice to have. A server is just a computer as well. A server is normally a third-party value. VPS is a server that is imitating a machine. So there has to be relationship between virtual and real. Now we're back to connecting to servers run by big companies. How to make an economic server, in terms of

34 Hardware

low energy consumation?

{34 38}

µHaving a real machine requires

to manage hardware. In the

commercial models you don't

know where are the machines,

who manages it. Soleus is an

association in the Netherlands,

you pay a fee and can have a

VPS. Low prices for fees and

servers to keep saved mem-

bers. Systerserver has low

specs, runs the websites for

Systerserver and /ETC. You

can get your own server, but

still need to run it. A good size

for a sustainable system is like

6. You don't spend too much

time communicating. It's

important that we make the

steps of having our own data

with us, not giving it to Google

or else. If you host data for

other people it represents more

responsibility. See Tim

Berners-Lee Solid software.

If you want to use Facebook or

Google, it should ask for a

permission to access our data.

µIs it our responsibility to make it more easy for other people to make their own server? Maybe we must be more friendly than big companies are. It's hard to get into self-managed servers if you don't have an interest in it. Do we want to create a world with many different Systerservers or making it all together?

Build and reach the Internet with an antenna from the roof
Ignifugo

I came to live to the countryside. This is the map of Bologna, and these are the potential nodes for the community wireless network. The orange nodes are the potential ones, the green are the effective ones. It is produced by Ninux, a group of people who deploy it. As you can see, there are two points in the countryside.

This is the panorama of where I live. There the Internet connection is very bad as there is no economic interest to make it better, and the communication is very important as you are living apart from your commu{27 nity in the city. So we built a grassroot network ¤with our hands with Ninux. There are more or less 2000 potential

36 DIY

nodes in Italy, 150 really

switched on. It’s configured like

islands, as they are mainly not

connected to one another.

Why starting this experience?

Because you can have really

better connection with your

friends, for activism as you can

run your network with your

rules, and also give more

attention to your privacy. You

can use the Net with more

neutrality, you can have your

application on your network,

it’s also more resilient and

resistent to catastrophs as it is

{24 38}

intern. >You can build and share

with your community and

assimilate things. This move-

ment is not new, it started at

the beginning of the 2000. It’s

shared all over the world and

there are different agreements

with the network communities.

There is an agreement on free

transit of packages in the net-

work and to open the commu-

nication, the warranty that you

can join the network (doesn’t

mean you can access all of the applications), the agreement terms say you have to be into free transit and communication warranty, and you can decide what you want to work on from your network. For instance in Italy there are islands in Roma, Bologna, Milano, Calabria, Sicily, all of us accept the agreements, in Calabria they made a modification on communication and it’s open to everyone, and it must be apparent that you give connectivity to the others. >It means you can start as a leaf, but you agree to become a branch. You become a roaming of the network. The services you can find on Ninux depend on what you put on your network. The aim of the community is to build infrastructure and powerful tools. By default there is nothing on Ninux. You can have open source software for sharing your storage, run any kind of platform you want,

share your Internet connection.

You have to connect the com-

puters as the Internet connec-

tion is not installed by default.

If one of the computers shares

band with ADSL, you can

divide connection.

Two common questions are: is

this stuff legal or dangerous. It

is legal, but in Italy might not

be for long again because of a

law, prohibiting to change the

softwares inside of routers.

And about dangerosity, the

antennas we use are really less

powerful than cellphones

antennas. To make it, you can

meet the people of Ninux and

assist to conferences. And you

have to go on the roof.

{35 39}

µYou need a wireless bridge,

5gHz frequency, between two

houses. The antenna, the rou-

ters, and your PC (on both

parts). The two places need to

see eachother from the roof.

Check if there is no mountain

between the two points you

want to join, no obstacles. The

choice of your antenna

depends on the power you

need. Trees are obstacles.

The waves smash when they

meet something. Fix the two

antennas. Inside, you get the

cable of the antenna, with one

Internet port (LAN), another

router for wifi connection. One

ADSL connection goes to the

power line, and this goes to the

antenna. It’s an antenna with

ethernet ports.

For the software, routers are

indeed little computers with an

operative system inside, the

firmware (the antenna also has

a firmware). It’s really easy,

you have a graphic interface

where you can update the

{37 39}

software. >I use Libremesh, it’s

all explained how to make it

work with the model of an-

tenna and router. It has a big

community, it is preconfi-

gurated for this use. If one node

is unavailable, the router

recalculates, reroutes to get the

connection. To maintain the

software it is a hard work.

{38 53}

>With an open software you can

manage the different needs of

different communities. Several

kind of configuration inside,

depends on how you want to

connect. You compile your

software and then you just

have to flash it. Freifunke in

Berlin works similarly.

Q|Do you have a schema of how it works? A||The waves go straight, the portance depends on the antenna. Like a pear shape. {38 µYou have to think of the way you place the antennas to make it optimal. I also give names to the routers, to separate those who repeat the signals and those with a special configuration. It helped a lot the community to fix problems.

From data to dating
Frocetaria

This project started from

collective Laboratori Masche-

ramienti, who works on help

{26 41}

(social, software help). ^We are

transfeminists, we don’t have a

space anymore. We started

thinking about data. A few

months ago, Grindr became

very popular for gay guys. But

Grindr is collecting data from

its users and selling it to

companies, in order to target people for advertisement, publicity and others. Same thing about Facebook, it is similar. Grindr is selling status about HIV status of its users, this is a big reach to privacy. When we are using this app, we are producing value that is picked by this company. This system is really cynical. There

40 Feminism

is also data about body, weight,

age that are sold. It specifies

things we are keen on spending

time and money for our appea-

rance. The question of HIV is

really problematic.

So how to conceptualize our

presence on this app? There is

production of value, and at the

same time reinforcement of

mainstream gender stereo-

types. Broadcasts this kind of

culture. So how do we change

this, and how to make visible

that we are working online?

Filling all the data is giving

value, but there is the work we

do outside also. We thought of

striking on this app. Take the

platform a few days off, and we

considered this after Uber

strike (the drivers made an

appeal to people using the app,

this was the only way it could

{40 53}

work). ^Our strategy would be

different, based on feminist

strikes, and ways we could use

the app to create moments for a

strike on March 8th.

{17 42}

`This is a way of making every-

one aware that everything we

do is put on work, our life is

put to work in a way. We

thought of a way to hack the

app, not interacting with its

structure but with the social

structure promoted by it. We

created an event in Bologna for

Grindr men "share your big

data". We all used the same

picture, it was an offline

treasure hunt in the city. Every

challenge was trying to bring

awareness on HIV data, how

our activity works, the cons-

truction of the ideal gay

masculine body. Then there

was another test, in the end it

was a huge illegal party in the

park. You have to know that

when you create a Grindr

profile, you have to declare

many things about who you are

and what you desire, and you

can select profiles you want to

see, can be based on races, so

being very racist. The events

happened in abandoned places,

Frocetaria

the area was places gentrified, where minorities are thrown out. Offline you get to meet different kind of people and bodies, the counter is completely different, you don’t decide the person you wil meet. The shift can change and become more creative.
Q|I think the question is more transversal than just meeting people. For example Facebook, this is a place to show your self. It sounds strange to go on strike on this app. Some people go for only sex meeting, but this a personal will. It is exacerbing individualism. But to me this is more to meet someone else. It is something you want to do? Those apps eliminate the real contact between people. This is something very deep. A||We agreed on that, one of the issues was to choose the app for hacking. When you’re using the app, you’re choosing

the body you want to meet, not

like cruising the city. The out-

comes of the apps is their own

architectures, shapes, a culture.

Dating apps are shifted on one-

to-one interactions. Why do

those platforms promote this

kind of interaction? This acts

on the construction of repre-

{41 43}

sentations. `Promoting a strike

on Grindr was because people

using it are implying them-

selves, you don’t share only

data but all the work it requires

to be here and appear the way

you want. The strike was about

giving opacity on that work. We

launched the idea of being paid

for what we do on those apps,

but that was a joke. There is a

question about free work. You

have the app on your phone, so

you can answer, work for it all

the time. You’re not paid but it

costs to you.

Q|I love the idea of criticizing activities on the Internet. I’m more doubted about the

42 Creativity/Arts

From data to dating

approach. Protests in social

media platform didn’t give

much. What you are doing is

going to MacDonald’s and get

on strike against them. Which

will not affect them at all, they

will restart the next day.

Grindr’s algorithms are much

more powerful than what we

can create. It would be more

interesting to inform in the real

world. We could multiply

parties, and call it "protests

against Grindr".

{42 44}

A||I completely agree. `But

the strike is not against Grindr

but gender normativity, free

visible work. We call it "the

strike from genders". The idea

is not to make Grindr change

their app. We want to create

our value, which is social,

through the app. The app is

like a bus.

Q|||So Grindr is just a

channel to create awareness?

A||||Yes, and if we

use geolocalisation to declare

we are somewhere, but actually

we’re striking and displaying photos to go to the strike. `We chose the app because as trans activists we start from ourselves. I feel the potential for revolution is lost in those interactions, they become supporters of capitalism, racism, transphobia. It’s already nice that we are here today. This is not the kind of message you usually get on the app.
Q|Just a specific question regarding the app: how technically did you think the strike on Grindr? You were talking about choice. On Grindr you can create a fake account and get insults for it. There is no real choice about how to use the app. Maybe education should be about that. Q|As I know, every single data is useful in economy of interaction, and my opinion is the diversity is richness for those datas. The production of value comes from our diversity.

Frocetaria

43 Creativity/Arts

{43 45}

A||`Mapping the city ena-

bles different landscapes. It is

also about matching what kind

of users are in each place.

We all used the same avatar to

organize the parties, we were

blocked by Grindr and had to

adjust our strategy. It is being

in the roots but breaking it.

The way you are involved in

the app, the event is important.

When we are aware of that, we

think better on how we can

deal with it. We are trying to

raise an awareness.

Q|||But maybe if we

just stopped specifying our

actions on Facebook we would

be stronger?

A||||I think what we

can do is outside the app.

Q|About the context of fake user, in Berlin I know someone who made art project on Grindr, and he needed to have real conversations, how did you deal with it? A||`We were very clear

that it was not about meeting from the beginning. We tried projects on Facebook too, it was about educating people we were talking with. A|||`I think it would be interesting creating scripts to meet people on the app. The idea of striking, can seem counter-productive as people want to suscribe to Grindr. But we had in idea examples where people responded to the strike. It would be about joining forces. We chose Grindr because we wanted to target queers, and it can be a way to make more feminists.
Q|But it is difficult to strike on something you are identifying on, you don’t want to be out of the society. It is like having a child. You live your life, go to work, but the time you don’t look at him, what is he going to do? So how can you strike on something you desire to be part of? I want to reclaim

44 Creativity/Arts

From data to dating

the fact that I create value on

this app, so I have to fight

against them but also besides

them.

A||When you are a sex

worker, you can use the app for

your work. But you’re not

welcome on it.

{44 52}

A|||`The target of our

action was not Grindr as a

company, but the user and the

interaction with him.

Q|Why wouldn’t there be chess table image on the app to say "I want to occupy it"? A||We were also looking for tips and feedbacks on the short, on the long term this is to get collaboration. Our real lives are outside but anyway we are using those apps. Q|||You use the system to get its limits? A||||We analyze it because it is our desire. Desires are taken by capitalism to make it normal. We wanted to act where the desire is.

Q|`Technology should be included in two dimensions of our lives, I would find interesting imagine how to associate this process with action. Invite people and give them documentation on how to act online. A||We want to bring back cruising spaces. Gentrified places used to be a place for gay people to meet, but it changed.
Q|Indymedia was important because it was all in one place, action, instruction. It would be interesting before launching an action to have a whole history and third personas to interact with.
Q|How did you use the app? What pictures? A||The problem is when you reach 3 times the same image you have to change. We used pants image with something on it. And it works. We tried with fake email and it works.

Create a website that cannot be hacked but looks awesome!

~I started using it not to have

spamming attacks, CMS

problems, so I need something

more solid. This is what Jekyll

{32 47}

is. #Your website is on your

machine, and you deploy your

code on the server. The server

is not related to your computer,

you just deploy HTML, CSS,

Javascript. You can use gems

to create other features of the

website, you can write markdowns instead of HTML. It is also very useful when you work with several people, like the /ETC website. All the people could learn how to work on it.
Q|#You can take any gems and install it? Do you have to take care of installing the proper line.

46 Security/Encryption Programming

A||No it is a package

{46 48}

#You have all the pages in one

folder, layout for each page.

The gemfile says what soft-

wares must be installed to run

the website. Jekyll language

plugin. You can deploy the

website in your local machine:

install some gems before

(bundler, that will install the

other gems). We use a parti-

cular theme, so this is heavier.

"bundle install" in the folder

compiles your website. "jekyll

new -name of your site-" to

create a new one. There are

many files in the website:

configuration, posts... So you

can deploy locally. You can edit

what you want, it’s all in the

same folder. There is a new

folder where your website has

been deployed: markdown was

converted into HTML. It inter-

prets it and creates a website

like you want it to look. To put

something online, it has to be

in the right folder. The script

makes Jekyll create the folder, and add the content of this folder to the server. We use Git to version altogether. The index file only contains metadata: yaml. In the config file you have info on the website: title, your theme, description. You can of course install another theme. The /ETC one is very flexible.
#Posts are cool with Jekyll: just create a file with markdown in the post folder. We can give a title, Jekyll knows its layout, we can decide what time it will be published, assign metadata (language). The markdown syntax for posts is very simple, for instance * for bold, - for ordered list, a link between [ ]. You can change a post just with intervention on it. You can then tweak your stylesheet Jekyll looks at what it has in each folder, in its own folder, you have to be in the folder where the gemfile is for it to work. Jekyll themes are very

Obaz

47 Programming

well documented. You can

choose the language you are

more comfortable with for the

theme deployment. Download

the theme from Git repository,

inside go to the test folder, you

can call it however you want

and use it as your website.

{46 50}

~When CMS or servers are not

updated after years, anybody

can hack it (Wordpress or

Drupal), while Jekyll is

updated and safe. It makes it

easier for people that are not

used to developing a website.

Editors for Jekyll don’t really

exist yet.

A||You have to install Ruby to use Jekyll, and download the gems. When gem installs, it looks at what you need (is it older versions). Bundler takes care of the rest.
On right page: screenshot of the /ETC website

Q|How would Jekyll interact with a static website? That has been archived for instance. A||Jekyll creates a static site from a folder. A website that has already been archived is not the same.

Dock, dock, docker

In the last years there has been a lot of talks about virtualization, and how to run a computer inside of another one. There is a host computer with any operating system. It can be Linux and run Windows machine with it. There is a full operating system for the host computer, and another kernel for guest computers.

Docker was built on Alexi. It’s a

container engine that runs all

{48 51}

the containers. If I have an

~application like a web server

running, Docker launches only

the small kernel for this com-

ponent. It is separated and very

secure. It creates separation of

resources. When you have a lot

of old stuff on your computer,

Docker enables to use your

50 Security/Encryption

computer as a transition device.

You can make container for an

install, a component, and

remove it when you don’t need

it anymore.

{48 61}

#You can create your local

development environments,

separated from other things.

When you start your container

you have it. Every Docker

image is built on another

Docker image. You can version

Docker images, combine it with

softwares, even with files on

distant repository. There are

some tools to combine multiple

images. Mostly oriented on

micro-services: applications

that do small things, you can

make small processes talk with

eachother. A database for

instance will be another

container. Micro-service is a

concept, it is about try to split

what you do in little parts.

Image is something that we

share and used to start the

process. Docker is command-

line software, you give it

arguments. You can tell it to

enter your container, remove

container, start processes.

someone enters your container,

Inter/depend-ence: the game
Sarrita

Let’s close up the chairs to be

{28 59}

all together. £This game is a

project I made with another

artist, we’ll go through playing

this game. Christine is working

on mutual support, this project

emerged in a residency in

Auckland. It’s called "Interde-

pence, the game", based on one

of Christine’s earlier works,

"Ways and means", leading

people to talk about how they feel with eachother. We wanted to give access to this game, so we developed a travel version of the game that people can download from the website. £You can also download a PDF with the instructions and cards and randomly generate new cards. I would like to play with you at least six rounds of the

55 Games

game. So like all games, there are players and roles. First we’ll distribute the roles by taking a sticker and put it on your shirt. There are talking sticks, some of you are question marks, lightning bolts, and bricks. We start with the pieces on the outside, and all the pieces must go together in the end. There are 4 steps per round. Question mark reads the question and quickly answers, the brick one answers the first question with an example (personal or not personal as you wish), lightning bolt reads another card and must answer considering the previous answer, and sticks player must summarize all that was said. The questions are about art or society in general, you choose.
Player 1|When and why don’t you participate? I don’t participate when I don’t feel I like the people I have to participate with.

Player 2|I recently walked

into a medical shop for a feet

treatment. It looks like a nor-

mal shop and in the back is the

{53 65}

doctor. ^He’s leaving me bare

foot in the shop, doing very

stupid sexist comment, so I

took my shoes and left the

shop.

Player 3|Find a pattern. I really don’t know.

Player 4|It was shared that one reason was the difference with other people, an example was given with a sexist doctor, so the decision was made not to continue the situation; it was difficult to find that pattern, we should think about situations when people refuse to participate. ^For instance if doctors are sexist, people affected by this may not look for male doctors or go through alternative medicine. A way would be to change the situation without having to leave it.

56 Feminism

Inter/de-pend-ence: the game

Let’s move to the next round, please go to someone else with the same sign as you do. Let’s restart with someone with a question mark.
Player 1|How would you rate the values of governments? No value... Oh, the values! They are an excuse for the existence of bureaucracy.
Player 2|When I was younger I was in a music school. Then I left for a bigger music school. I had the highest level in my previous school, in the second one they didn’t let me attend a class to my level, they made me pass tests. They judged me exageratly because I was from a small city.
Player 3|Make it more positive. Change the place where you have to go, organize with the others to make it different.

Player 4|The question was how would you rate the values of the governments? It was said no values. The example was about a music school where level was not respected. This is sad but to make it more positive we can try to change things.
Ok, let’s make another round, please find your symbol.
Player 1|In what ways do you collaborate with others? Usually I collaborate with others by making practical activities together, by discussing, by organizing events, by answering specific needs.
Player 2|When we organized /ETC here we speaked a lot and had many meetings and talks.
Player 3|Cross a boundary. If there is a boundary, cross it.

Sarrita

57

Player 4|The question was about collaboration with others, through activities, discussing, by participating in general assemblies, talking politics. For instance, for this /ETC the organization took a lot of collaboration. The redraw of collaboration is through crossing the language barrier.
Ok, who didn’t have a role? Let’s make a new round.
Player 1|How much do you think the current existing country serves the majority of residents? It doesn’t consider all the residents in the country. It feels the role of a country is difficult for me, I would replace country by state, because for me a country is not an organization, it’s a territory.
Player 2|In Germany huge parks of organizations work with unemployed people, and at the same time work that is

created doesn’t answer to the needs of the people. Looks like we have less unemployed people, but that’s not the real problem. It’s a public lie.
Player 3|Expand the field. Expanding the concept of country makes me think that countries don’t exist, what can serve us is ignoring the countries.
Player 4|What does the country do for the residents? It doesn’t consider all the residents the same way, the example was about Germany and employment situation, and to extend we talked about the boundaries.
Ok, so let’s say we made six rounds and all the pieces ended up together. Does anyone has thoughts to share?
Q|In my mind questions could have been more interes-

Q|£Maybe the game could

have been axed on more two

rounds to bring further the

discussions.

Q|£Indeed your game is about changing your point of view from a topic.

Q|£Are your questions decided randomly? I feel a kind of pressure in this game, because when I talk I concentrate all the attention on me, maybe we could think about how to play it in group. And cards, are they all good, or was I lucky to have the funny ones? Q||I feel I could pick more than one question. A|||If the first one doesn’t work you can pick another one.

{53 60}

Q|`I think the game is

relevant if you are in the art

field, but it might be less if you are in another field and don’t have those connections. A||I guess what is interesting is to ask questions you don’t ask in your everyday life.
Q|||`Yes, but it separates art and general life, I don’t think things should be separated that way. Q||||`Personnally I still have troubles defining myself as an artist, so I would like to think art institutions maybe as normal institutions. A|||||But I like the fact that you can appropriate the topics, you can relate it to your own participation or as you wish. Another interesting point is the random selection of questions. Lots of questions have to do with collaboration, empowerment, autonomy. Like 20% of the whole deck is about institutions, countries...

Q|`This thing of labelling art and not art is interesting in a way because it reflects the way we think it. Art is something everyone has a concept of, so it’s kind of universal.

Q|`In a way, when you’re an artist, it’s legit that you apply your thoughts to art.

F12 how to use a web inspector
Ignifugo

The /ETC website will be a

good point to start. Different

levels of markup, the resource

{51 62}

is on a server. #The server

communicates with us by a

protocol (HTTPS): the trans-

mission of HTTP is made by

encryption. There is the HTML

page, the layer where is the

content of the page, the CSS

is the graphical part of the web

page, and there is Javascript to manage interaction. We can disassemble the web page in 3 levels: content, action, graphic part. HTML is a markup language, CSS too with keys and values, Javacript is for functions and logical part. The web inspector is useful to understand if you reach the source, if the server is reached.

61 Programming

You can also understand better

the source. You need to reload

when you change something.

You can analyze the web page

point by point, select what you

want to modify. The CSS

selector to manage the cascade

style: understand how the

selector functions. For ins-

tance sometimes the selector is

too precise and you can see it

with this tool. You can get the

selector of a group if you want

to modify it all. When you work

with :hover, active links, it is

very useful to see the selector

and its rules. Important infor-

mations are the key values of

the CSS, how the rules apply

on eachother if the selectors

are very specific.

{61 64}

#The flexible view is also some-

thing nice, to see your page in

different sizes, you can take

screenshots. This is for the

responsive size of the website.

You can ask for the media

queries (min-width or max-

width), knowing that the res-

ponsive depends on the device, the design you use, so you have to play with it. There is also the console. It is useful to experiment. Normally the script is at the bottom of the HTML page or in its own folder. jQuery has modules you can call on objects on Javascript. Concatenation of functions is important. #Toggle to assign something and see an interaction (play with classes). The console helps see if a script works or not.
Q|I know there are browsers blockers for Javascript, why so if it is so used? A||Because it can be invasive I guess. With Javascript you can get things like position of cursor or else... Q|||Maybe because we can get the sources with it? A||||I don’t think so. This must be specific about tracking.

A Brief History of feminism and technology
Zeyev

We will look at some paralell development in both fields. I will use a framework based on western hegemony, it received some criticism, but it makes reference as there are not that many moment. It is used by searchers to talk about the moments.

First period starts in the end of

the XIXth century and its main

issue is reaching equality with

{66 68}

men. It was a time where

^women had no property right,

and access to education, get

more jobs for women (they

could not access all). The right

to vote was a huge point, we

can find some writings about

democracy and the fact that is

67 Feminism

is the side of men. Women

suffrage is very recent, in the

XXth century voting rights to

women expanded. But not for

every women, if you were a

working class it was not ok. In

the Middle East women had

the right to vote but it was

revoked. Switzerland gave it in

1971 only.

In the technological lanscape,

we are in second industrial

Revolution, with some tech-

nology like sewing machines.

{67 69}

^It could bring women some

money, out of their husbands

and families. Infrastructures

were changing with electricity

and telecommunications, and

the very beginning of compu-

ting age. Technology opened

job market to the city, gave a

little form of empowerment to

women. In the city you had

new contact with other people.

^But a strong gendered dis-

course on technology arrives at

the same time. The dichotomy

was between men who concei-

ved technology and women who only used it. The society of consumption was under way too, but not directed to women. ^Sylvia Pankhurst was a suffragette, and this movement was mostly for bourgeoisie women. So she tried to bring together socialism and feminism, to extend the movement. She struggled to include working class women, so it implied technology. Another person from this period was Hilde Krasmogonowi, she was not a feminist but an german officer. During the Cold war there was a debate on kitchens: US was promoting the idea of kitchen full of tools, very cool, and women were arguing with this. Women like Hilde wanted communal kitchen. Those kitchens are traps: you are always in there cooking. She didn’t want to go this direction but discuss how to share housework.

68 Feminism

A Brief History of feminism and technology

Second wave starts in the 60-

70s’, there is a shift between

focus on equality and diffe-

{68 70}

rence. ^What is our difference

with men and how should it be

expressed? Simone de Beauvoir

was president of this second

wave. Women want to be

independent from their male

counterpart. Main criticism to

previous wave is equality can

not be reached by having

rights, the problem is deeper,

cultural and we must change

the society. Ideology built in the

past needs to change. Personal

is political, it is about how you

behave and follow feminist

ideas. New practices appear

too, like self-consciousness:

becoming more aware of what

it is to be a woman. Divorce is

legal in Italy from the 1970s’,

reproduction is a problem too.

Abortion right is legal in 1987.

Woman killing for cheating is

illegal only in 1991. Until 1992,

if you rape a woman and marry

her after, you wouldn’t have

problems. Until 1996, raping a woman was not a crime against the woman but against moral. First personal computers appear and engineering too. Plastics are more and more present, which implies a technological development of mass computers. ^Main link between feminism and technology is the debate about reproductive technology: who can access contraception, which circumstances for abortion... this is called reproductive technologies because technologies and medicine must act. There are debates about medicalisation of child birth, the woman is not considered as able to give birth by herself anymore. This period is more collective. Feminist science fiction writers use it as a way to talk about gender and society on other dimensions, planets. Rotezora was a women only guerilla group in Germany, they made sabotage acts. The first act was

Zeyev

69 Feminism

on reproductive technologies. They learnt technology doing it so it was also a learning group.

{69 71}

^Third movement is in the end

of the 80's, based on criticism

of old conceptions of feminism,

that is too much about western

white women. Racist and class

oppression must be discussed

at the same time. Ecology is an

important part, also queer

fights. How can we think a

cyberspace where genders and

issues will be different? There

are many unfinished stories in

those fights, like violence on

women. There is an expansion

of feminist perspective: non-

white, non-feminists too. The

movement is more diverse,

goes to civic rights.

On a technological landscape, it

is a boom period with personal

computers, global infrastruc-

tures like transports are

becoming better and better. In

electronic industry, small

countries make the pieces rich

countries designed. People in poor countries don’t have the knowledge as they only make little pieces. Global capitalism is more and more prevalent, and seems like technoloy can solve everything. ^There is a huge interest in women history as makers of technology, while they have been neglected before. Movement for applications of technology that follow the fight: agriculture, ecology. Bertha Cacheres was an activist in Honduras, she got murdered during the fight against a building being built without consultation of the population. And many other ecological activists had the same fate. Angela Davis is one of the main voices of black feminism: intersection of women and technology and how it makes racism, like with reproduction technologies where we control who gives birth for instance. ^Fica Futura was a magazine of the

70 Feminism

A Brief History of feminism and technology

90s’, it was an italian hacking /counter-culture magazine, with feminist criticism of technology. So should we talk about feminism or feminisms? I think feminism, because there is something that links all women struggles. There are many different stories, perspectives, priorities, practices. Technology was always part of the feminist debate. It was such a vital part of western identity in the XXth century. Should technology be more explicitely part of feminism history? The question is open.
Q|I didn’t know about the struggle for kitchen. And it started already as a collective discourse. {70 A||^This debate must be seen in the historical moment. The woman was responsible in the family for everything, and wanted to share tasks with other women, not only with men.

Q|||^But the problem was: women were working the whole day in the kitchen. It is a way of getting freedom in the space? A||||^From the 80s’ there were articles about how to take your man out of the computer, bringing also women to learn from it. But the purpose was to keep your marriage.

Animata: an uncommon free software approach to mapped anti-visuals

{60 `Animata is a real-time animation software, designed to create interactive background projections for concerts, theatre and dance performances. The peculiarity of the software is that the animation - the movement of the puppets, the changes of the background - is generated in real-time, making continuous interaction pos-

sible. `This ability also permits that physical sensors, cameras or other environmental variables can be attached to the animation of characters, creating a cartoon reacting to its environment. You can create a virtual puppet band reacting to live audio input, or set up a scene of drawn characters controlled by the movement of

73 Creativity/Arts

dancers. The software can be

run on multiple operation

systems like Mac OS X, GNU

{66 75}

Linux and Windows. >Animata

can be connected with wide-

spread programming environ-

ments (e.g. Max /MSP, Pure-

Data, EyesWeb) used by

multimedia developers and

artists in order to make use of

the possibilities of these appli-

cations in the fields of image

editing, sound analysis, or

motion capture. Installing

Animata requires FLTK (1.1.x)

http: / /www.fltk.org.

{64 75}

#On Windows Animata is

compiled from Cygwin (http: /

Git explained with toys
Ignifugo + Obaz

Let’s make on intro for Git.

There is a video online of

someone doing something like

{74 76}

that on a Linux tutorial. #So Git

is a versioning system, it allows

to keep track in all version of

files in a directory (a reposi-

tory). It is normally used for

developing software, but it is

also used for developing web-

sites (like Systerserver does).

You can use it if you want to

keep track of what happens in

{74 76}

a folder. This is for collabora-

tion, >so decentralized. Copies

can be in other computers, and

other people can see your

changes. Systerserver uses

Gitlab, the folder is where the

website is developed. You don’t

need a central server to update,

just keep Git in the folder to

75 Programming Free & Open source

{75 keep track. >You can use Gitlab

or Github, or a repository on

your machine. Inside the direc-

tory, you tell it to become a

repository and Git will start

tracking. I can tell it where its

central server is. It can be

public or private to restrict the

access on it. When you create a

repository, you have a setup

explanation, an address on a

server.

{75 77}

#"git remote add" to tell it where

the central server is. The "git

init" folder contains all Git

needs to run. Configuration file

with the address of the remote.

First thing is to fill a README,

this is just the first description.

#"git pull" to withdraw from the

repository. If the repository

orginally exists on a distant

server, "git clone" to have it on

your machine. So now you

want to add something. You

create a file, write something in

it. But Git doesn’t know that.

You have to show it. Git gives a

number to the commit, a label:

it means Git recorded the changes. Git doesn’t know your change is here, it doesn’t have a number. #So you need to tell Git it is here by adding this: "git add". Then Git adds a label to the pull, becomes a new Git object. Then you tell Git that this is a change in the project, you commit with a message. So now master branch added it. To inform the server about it, "git push". Master label advanced on the server too.
Q|Commit is something you do on your machine? A||You do it locally yes, and then push to the server.
Now you want to do something but not sure you want to change all the project. So you create a new branch. You have to be in this branch to modify it. You can decide to merge this branch to the master branch if you are certain. But if you are not, you push the changes to

76 Free & Open source Programming

Git explained with toys

the new branch. When someone reviews it, they can access the two branches. To merge you can create a merge request, with explanation on what you are doing. Assign this request to the most responsible person to make sure it won’t break the whole project. {76 #From your local machine, if you want to merge, go to master and "git merge -name of the branch-". And it’s done. Instead of branching a project, you can create your own. To do this, fork a project from Gitlab or Github, you will have a new repository. If you share it on Git, other people can start working on it too. Fork a website for instance can be a good way to test it locally. If someone changed the same thing as you did and update, changes will be conflicting. You can fix this, see the conflicting lines. You can also revert your changes with the number of the commit.

#Before you "git push" it is good practice to "git pull", to check if there was changes to the branch. You can pick commits by their numbers, it’s called cherry picking: "git cherrypick".
Q|With cherry picking you basically change the history of the workflow. A||Sometimes it makes sense. You will avoid a conflict, you need to change one thing but not another. Besides adding objects, you can also remove objects. It is also possible to move files. Whenever you change something, you have to add, commit, and don’t update before you get the repo.
